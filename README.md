# Dynamic Routing Internationalization with Next.js

## Overview:

This repository showcases an implementation of dynamic routing internationalization using the Next.js App Router, along with React Toolkit (RTK), TypeScript (TS), Tailwind CSS, and JSON demo data.

### Key Features:

- **Next.js App Router**: Leverages the powerful routing capabilities of Next.js to create a seamless internationalized experience.
- **React Toolkit (RTK)**: Utilizes RTK for state management, ensuring efficient and scalable state handling.
- **TypeScript (TS)**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience with TypeScript integration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employs Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and customization.
- **JSON Demo Data**: Uses JSON data for demo purposes, simulating a real-world scenario.

### Functionality:

- **Default Language Setup**: Defines default languages for the application, providing a base for internationalization.
- **Language Selection**: Implements a language selection feature that allows users to change the language dynamically.
- **Route Parameters**: Integrates language selection into the routing mechanism, ensuring the selected language is reflected in the URL parameters.

Explore the code and see how these modern technologies come together to create a robust and dynamic internationalized application.
